        <h2>
        <strong>Input tag kinds have been expanded</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>Input is an old attribute that has been resurrected in <b>HTML</b> with new values such as <u>email</u>, <u>month</u>, <u>number</u>, <u>range</u>, <u>search</u>, <u>tel,</u> <u>week</u>, <u>URL,</u> <u>time</u> and etc.

           <br> These are the new values that the input tag may include.
            </p>

        <h2>
        <strong>ContentEditable</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>It’s a characteristic that allows us to make changes to the content. It makes determining Where we see Is What we Get a breeze. By clicking on the content, we will be able to change it.
        </p> 
        
        <h2>
            <strong>Progress</strong>
        </h2>
            <p>This tag is used to monitor the status of a job while it is being completed.
             we may use the progress tag in conjunction with JavaScript. It’s similar to a progress bar.
        </p>

        <h2>
            <strong>section</strong>
        </h2>
            <p>The section tag is used to split a document into sections. 
            For instance, an article may include many parts, such as a header, footer, newest news, and a section for the primary material, among others.
        </p>

        <h2>
            <strong>Main</strong>
        </h2>
            <p>Main is a tag that is used to encapsulate the page’s primary content. 
                There can’t be more than one main tag in a document, and this tag can’t be within the article aside, footer, or header tags. The navigation bar, header, and footer are not included.
